## Introduction
Background on the GIS problem and objectives.
Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are essential for spatial data analysis and visualization. However, not
all data formats are readily compatible with GIS platforms like ArcGIS Pro. This project addresses the
challenge of importing a JSON dataset-specifically, 2018 New Orleans Land Value data-into ArcGIS Pro. The
JSON data contains geometries in Well-Known Text (WKT) format and various attributes. The goal is to build
a Python-based ArcGIS Toolbox tool that automates the conversion of this JSON data into a shapefile,
allowing for seamless visualization and further spatial analysis within ArcGIS Pro.
